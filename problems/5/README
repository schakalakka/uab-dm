Deterministic Modelling: Exercise 5
Authors: Alba Gordó, Claudia Jiménez Martín, Stefano Pedarra and Andreas Radke

Requirements: Python 3.6+
Libraries: Pygal, Numpy

'python3 5_general.py' plots the consiered function for different µ's together with the diagonal
'python3 5_orbitdiagram.py' plots the orbit/bifurcation diagram of the considered function
'python3 5_logisticsmap.py' plots the orbit diagram of the logistics map

All the plots can be seen in the *.png/svg files.

Our main work/solution can be found in Report_5.pdf
